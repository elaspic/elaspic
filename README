INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

1) Install BLAST, MODELLER and TCOFFEE and modify the .bashrc file accordingly.
If you install all three programs in your home directory, your bashrc
file should look something like this:

# BLAST
export PATH=$HOME/ncbi-blast-2.2.29+/bin:$PATH

# t_coffee
export DIR_4_TCOFFEE=$HOME/tcoffee
export MAFFT_BINARIES=$DIR_4_TCOFFEE/plugins/linux/
export CACHE_4_TCOFFEE=$HOME/.t_coffee/cache/
export TMP_4_TCOFFEE=$DIR_4_TCOFFEE/tmp/
export LOCKDIR_4_TCOFFEE=$DIR_4_TCOFFEE/lck/
export PERL5LIB=$DIR_4_TCOFFEE/perl:$PERL5LIB
export EMAIL_4_TCOFFEE=alex.strokach@utoronto.ca
export PATH=$DIR_4_TCOFFEE/bin:$PATH

# MODELLER
export PATH=$HOME/modeller9.13/bin/mod9.13:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/modeller9.13/lib/x86_64-intel8:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/modeller9.13/modlib:$HOME/modeller9.13/lib/x86_64-intel8/python2.5:$PYTHONPATH


2) It is recommended that you use python2.7 for this project. If your system
comes with an earlier version of python, you should download and compile 
python2.7 binaries from source. Use "make altinstall" instead of 
"make install" to prevent any system python binaries from being overwritten.
Also, you must send the following options to ./configure in order for
the required python packages to work: 
--enable-unicode=ucs4 --enable-ipv6 --with-dbmliborder=gdbm:bdb --with-threads
The "--enable-unicode=ucs4" is particularly important; the other options may
be ommitted (I think).

After you have a python2.7 binaries, it is recommended that you set up
a virual python environment to work with the elaspic project. 
The instructions on how to do this can be found on the virtualenv and
virtuanenvwrapper websites:
virtualenv http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
virtualenvwrapper http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

Once you activate the virtual environment, the python packages required
for elaspic can be installed using "pip install -r requirements.txt"

If you would like a development environment with a working copy of Spyder,
you also have to run "pip install -r requirements_dev.txt" and copy the
elaspic/src/postmkvirtualenv file to your .virtualenvs path (or make 
symbolic links contained in that file manually). 


3) All other binaries required to run elaspic come precompiled in the elaspic/bin
folder. If you are running a strange flavour of linux, you may have to compile
some of those libraries from source. The script elaspic/src/install_required_binaries.sh
is designed to streamline this process.




KNOWN BUGS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
--------------------------------

To dos:
1) Alter the code for parsing pfam domain definitions and remove domains that are inside other domains
