mCSM: predicting the effects of mutations in proteins using graph-based signatures.

  - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24281696

  - "To understand the roles of mutations in disease, we have evaluated their impacts not only on protein stability but also on protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions".

Predicting Binding Free Energy Change Caused by Point Mutations with Knowledge-Modified MM/PBSA Method

  - http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1004276

  - "The core of the SAAMBE method is a modified molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) method with residue specific dielectric constant".

  - \cite{petukh_predicting_2015}


MAESTRO \cite{laimer_maestro_2015}

  - https://biwww.che.sbg.ac.at/?page_id=477

  - MAESTRO implements a multi-agent machine learning system.

  - Structure based tools AUTO-MUTE [7], CUPSAT [8], Dmutant [9], FoldX [10], Eris [11], PoPMuSiC [12], SDM [13] or mCSM [14] usually perform better than the sequence based counterparts. Recently, SDM and mCSM have been integrated into a new method called DUET [15].


INPS: predicting the impact of non-synonymous variations on protein stability from sequence

  - http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/17/2816.long

  - Here, we describe INPS, a novel approach for annotating the effect of non-synonymous mutations on the protein stability from its sequence.

FireProt: Energy- and Evolution-Based Computational Design of Thermostable Multiple-Point Mutants

  - http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1004556

  - Predict the structural effect of multiple mutations.

  - "Stability effects of all possible single-point mutations were estimated using the <BuildModel> module of FoldX".

  -

  - We demonstrate that thermostability of the model enzymes haloalkane dehalogenase DhaA and Î³-hexachlorocyclohexane dehydrochlorinase LinA can be substantially increased.
