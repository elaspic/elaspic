ELASPIC
=======

ELASPIC is a metapredictor which combines sequential features (most important being PROVEAN) with structural features (most important being FoldX). It uses the Stochastic Gradient Boosting algorithm for machine learning.

  - ELASPIC is designed to work on the genome-wide scale by using homology models.
  - It predicts mutation :math:`\Delta \Delta G` for protein folding and protein interactions.
  - It is open source and can be installed and ran locally.
